# Policy 06 - Leave of Absence

* **If you wish to go on a Leave of Absence \(LOA\), fill out** [**this form**](https://forms.gle/AweLfSNNPDevCAcr7) **and an Employment Team Member will contact you once your request has been processed. They will let you know if your request has been accepted or denied, and if they need any more information from you.** 
* **The following reasons are valid reasons for absence:**
  * **Vacation**
  * **Funeral Leave**
  * **Medical Leave**
  * **Educational Purposes**
  * **Issues with family**
  * **Device Problems**
  * **Special Circumstances**
* **The following reasons are reasons for your LOA request being denied:**
  * **An excessive amount of LOAs**
  * **Invalid reason**
* **Leave of Absences should be requested only in the event that you cannot play Roblox. If you are wanting to take a break to play other games, it may be best to give your spot on the team to someone else.** 
* **If it is determined that you are not sticking to your LOA reason, \(E.g. saying you need to focus on school but are spending hours on Roblox\), your LOA will be revoked.**
* **Members may only be on notice for up to ten \(10\) days a month.**
* **Leave of Absences must be a minimum of  3 days in length.**
* **If your notice absolutely needs to be more than ten \(10\) days, a Board of Directors must approve it. The reason must be valid enough for this to happen, and the Board of Directors has the power to approve an extra \(10\) days. We do have hearts however, so if there is something serious, you may request more days and it will be accepted on a case by case basis.**
* **While on leave, you are not permitted to attend any shifts, sessions, or perform any other HR-related duties.** 
* **If for some reason the return date needs to be changed, you must contact a Board of Executives+ for a leave extension. A Board of Directors must approve the extension if it goes past ten \(10\) days.**
* **You can always end a Leave of Absence early. In order to do so, contact a Board of Executives+**
