# Policy 04 - Account Safety

* **It is an HR Team member’s full responsibility to ensure that their account remains secure at all times. This applies to all accounts utilized by the community for successful operations, such as Roblox, Discord, and Trello accounts. Only the account owner may have access to their account during their time here as an HR Team member meaning their account may never be shared with anyone to prevent abuse.**
* **It is recommended that you enable 2-Factor Verification where applicable to your account, or make any further safety measures to safeguard your account.** 
* **In the event that your account is hacked or stolen, we will immediately terminate you from your position until an investigation is completed.**
* **In the event that the hacker abuses a Summary Hotels asset, you will be held accountable and responsible and may stay terminated.** 
* **In the event that the hacker did something minor, you may be warned or demoted based upon the decision made by Corporate Team.** 
* **If you feel that your account is hacked and want to protect yourself from any harm while taking the corrective action to remove the hacker’s access, you may contact an administrator to temporarily demote you.**
