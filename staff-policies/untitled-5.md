# Policy 05 - Resignation Policy

* **If you wish to resign, you must notify a Board of Executives+ during the time you wish to resign, making sure they acknowledge and receive your message. If you resign without an officer knowing, it will be considered that you did not notify someone before leaving.**
* **When resigning, you will have the option to be demoted to Noted Customer if you are an Executive Officer+.**
* **You may not mention you are resigning in any server anytime before you officially declare you are leaving. This is to prohibit people from gaining attention by saying “I’m resigning in 6 hours” and then declare that you are actually staying later. You may only say your goodbyes once a Board of Executives+ is aware that you are resigning. If you do this, you will just be terminated.**
* **We highly encourage you to take time to think about your resignation, as you cannot return to your old rank once you declare that you want to resign.**
* **When resigning, you will have a maximum of ten \(10\) minutes to say your goodbyes in our management server before being removed from it. Once the time is up, you may continue to say your goodbyes in direct messages if needed. Resignation letters are not allowed to be posted in SH servers, except for Head Officers and above who are resigning. Mass pinging your resignation will result in your message being deleted and your account banned from both the management and main discord server for the safety and the courtesy of others.**
* **Once you resign, you have 48 hours until your resignation is official, in those 48 hours you may claim your rank back if you changed your mind.**
* **If you leave on BAD TERMS, you will be blacklisted from becoming a staff member again and banned from all Summary Hotels related games.**
* **If you leave within the first thirty \(30\) days of your employment as a Senior Manager, you will be blacklisted from becoming a management member for two \(2\) months.**

### **Disciplinary Action**

* **Failure to notify a Board of Executives+ that you are leaving will cause you to become blacklisted from becoming a management member again for a maximum of two \(2\) months.**
