# Policy 02 - Promotion Requirements

## Purpose

**For Promotion to All Ranks**

* **No disciplinary action within the previous thirty (30) days.**
* **No marked inactivity within the previous three (3) weeks.**
* **No active promotion holds for other reasons (Hinting for promotion, etc.)**
* **No Leave of Absences for the past two (2) weeks (Only applies to LOAs over 5 days).**
* **Be your current rank for at least three (3) weeks.**
* **Good overall behavior towards other community members.**
* **Meets minimum activity requirements consistently and tries to go above them.**

**Priority Status**

* **Users get the “priority” status when they are at their current rank for a certain amount of time. When the promotion process begins, these are the people who are considered first over those who do not have priority status. This system allows the Corporate Team to ensure that no one is being looked over. **
* **The amount of time it takes to get priority status varies between ranks.**
* **Just because someone is labeled as a priority, does not mean they will be promoted as other things than just the time you are a certain rank go into promotions. Those who go above and beyond however may be considered over you. If you are just doing the bare minimum, you won’t be promoted quickly.**
