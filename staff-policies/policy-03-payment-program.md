# Policy 03 - Payment Program

**The management member\(s\) \(excluding Senior Managers and Executive Officers\) who are the most active overall at the end of each month will receive a Robux payout and be named “HR of the Month.” The person who has is the second most active overall will also get a smaller Robux payout and an honorable mention.**

* **HR of the Month \(Most Active\)  - 1,000 R$**
* **Honorable Mention \(2nd Most Active\) - 500 R$**
* **To figure out who is the “most active,” administrators will take into account the number of sessions and shift minutes you have as well as other variables like helping others in the community.** 
* **Administrators \(Board of Executives+\) will receive a monthly salary of 500 R$ \(6,000 R$/yr\) and Senior Administrators will receive a predetermined amount of Robux as well if they accept the money. Those who do not meet the standards and expectations set by their superiors will be contacted privately and not paid for that month.**
* **Payment is given out in the form of Robux via the Summary Hotels group funds.**
* **Please keep in mind that we would like to see members performing a variety of management duties. This means we do not want to see people just attending trainings and doing shifts, but also people replying to Discord tickets, the group wall, and going above and beyond what is expected of you.**
* **Receiving payment is a privilege and not a right. Corporate Team has every right to deny you a payout at any time for any reason, or no reason at all. Not every large group pays its employees.**
* **If an employee has received any disciplinary action for the month, they are not considered for HR of the month.**
